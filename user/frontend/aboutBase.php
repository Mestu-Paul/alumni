    friends but find it
    hard to stay connected with other varsity mates. Contacts between
    alumni can be used
    to business connection and to gain references or insight in a new
    field Alumni work
    can consist of alumni mentoring students, organizing alumni days,
    having training
    sessions during allumni days for alumni, inviting alumni to give
    lectures, arranging
    work practices and proposing topics of theses, raise funds for the
    organizations. Its
